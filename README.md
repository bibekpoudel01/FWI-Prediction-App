This Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model to estimate fire risk using meteorological and environmental data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall; the project is currently in progress, and no major development was completed today due to time and energy limitations, so this update is made to maintain project continuity and consistency, with planned next steps including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
